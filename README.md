# My Personal Project
Project is deployed on Azure under this link: https://personal-project-pwojcieszak.azurewebsites.net/. Deployed version has limited functionality, I highly recommend runnning project locally using docker-compose.

This project is intended to be a more attractive alternative to the traditional resume and to showcase my skills I've gained by doing minor projects. I can't show everything here so I encourage you to browse the rest of my portfolio on GitHub. On the "About this project" subpage, I describe one by one all the technologies used in the project.

# How to run the application locally using Docker
Run `docker-compose up -d` to start the applications. After giving services some time to register with Discovery Service visit `localhost:8080`.
